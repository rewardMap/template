# Example task structure.
# The agent starts in state 0
0:
  # After taking action 0 (e.g. left) or 1 (e.g. right)
  # they get to the next state (1) with 80 % probability or (2) with 20 %
  0:
    next: [1, 2] # Indicate the state the agent is visiting next
    prob: 0.8 # This describes the transition probability.
  1:
    next: [2, 1]
    prob: 0.8
1: [3, 4] # Arriving in state 1, there's a binary choice (3, 4) where action 0
          # takes the agent deterministically to state 3 and action 1 to state 4.
